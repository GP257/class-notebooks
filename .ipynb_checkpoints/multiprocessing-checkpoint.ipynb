    "However, the GIL does not apply to multi-process programming, as each process runs in its own memory space and has its own GIL. In a multi-process environment, multiple processes can run Python bytecodes concurrently, each in its own separate process. This means that the GIL is not a bottleneck in multi-process programming, and can provide better performance on multi-core systems compared to multi-threading.\n",
